# TODO motel twitch interface, allow clients w/ sufficient
# permissions to quickly update movement strategy speed /
# rotatation axis / etc. Intended to be invoked over the
# udp transport
#
# Would require a tighter movement cycle for these types of
# locations along w/ a more granular callback system. Perhaps
# alternative implementations of these mechanisms can be
# provided in parallel the motel subsystem
