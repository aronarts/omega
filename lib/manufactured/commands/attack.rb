# Represents action of one {Manufactured::Ship} attacking another
#
# Registered with the registry by a client when attacker commences
# attacking and periodically run by registry until attacked stops,
# defender is destroyed, or one of several other conditions occur.
#
# Invokes {Omega::Server::Callback}s registered with the attacker
# and defender before/during/after the attack cycle with the event type,
# the attacking ship, and the defending ship as params
#
# The callback events/types invoked include:
# * 'attacked_stop' - invoked on the attacker when attacker stops attacking
# * 'attacked_stop' - invoked on the defender when attacker stops attacking
# * 'attacked'      - invoked on the attacker when attacker actually launches the attack
# * 'defended'      - invoked on the defender when attacker actually launches the attack
# * 'destroyed'     - invoked on the defender if this attack cycle resulted in the defender hp becoming <= 0
